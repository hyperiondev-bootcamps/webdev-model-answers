        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>
          One of my favourite hobbies as a child was <b>reading</b>. I remember
          spending countless hours immersed in fantasy worlds, imagining myself
          as the hero of the story.

          <em>
            Reading allowed me to escape into different worlds and sparked my
            imagination.

        <h2>Outdoor Play</h2>
        <p>
          I also loved playing <b>outdoors</b> with my friends. We would explore
          the neighbourhood, build forts, and play imaginative games until the
          sun went down.

            Outdoor play taught me the value of teamwork and encouraged
            creativity.

        <p>
          <b>LEGO</b> was one of my favourite toys growing up. I enjoyed
          building elaborate structures and letting my imagination run wild with
          endless possibilities.

          Another toy I cherished was my collection of <b>toy cars</b>. I spent
          hours racing them around imaginary tracks and staging epic car chases.
