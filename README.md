# Web Development Bootcamp Model Answers Repository

Welcome to the **Model Answers** repository for the Web Development Bootcamp.

This repository contains completed solutions to selected tasks from the bootcamp curriculum. These solutions are intended to serve as reference material for your learning and revision.

## What You’ll Find Here

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific task or module. Inside these folders, you may find:

- **Code solutions**: Python scripts, HTML/CSS/JS files, Jupyter Notebooks, or other formats depending on the task.
- **Model Answer Approach**: A write-up (usually in Markdown or PDF) explaining the thinking and approach behind the solution. This may include:
  - Problem breakdown
  - Key concepts used
  - Reasoning behind the implementation
  - Assumptions and limitations (if any)

## How to Navigate

1. Browse through the folders in the repository.
2. Each folder is named after a task (e.g. `05-001_Web Development Overview`).
3. Open the folder to view:
   - Code files (e.g. `.py`, `.ipynb`, `.html`)
   - Optional model answer explanations (`README.md`, `.pdf`, or `.md`)

## Tips for Use

- These answers are not the only correct solutions — they are one of potentially many valid approaches.
- Use them to:
  - Understand structure and logic
  - Compare with your own approach
  - Revise concepts
- Avoid copy-pasting — try to understand the reasoning and recreate the logic on your own.

## Academic Integrity

Please remember:
- These solutions are shared to support your learning — not to bypass your own effort.
- Misuse of these resources (e.g. plagiarism) may result in disciplinary action.

## Access & Updates
